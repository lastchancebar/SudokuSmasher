  # About Sudoku Smasher
  Sudoku Smasher is a Python terminal game. It is deployed on Heroku and uses a mock terminal made by Code Institute.

  Users can play the classic game of Sudoku popularised in modern times by the Nokoli puzzle company in Japan. Studies have shown that Sudoku exercises the brain's working memory and doing the puzzle has been found to improve the memory of older people.(source-Wikipedia)

  Users can select an easy, medium or hard Sudoku puzzle to solve, are alerted if they make an incorrect selection on a square, and after finishing the puzzle users can see the correct solution.
